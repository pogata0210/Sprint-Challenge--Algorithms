#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The operation is dirrectily affecting the size of n. There for the time is increasing linearly with the size of the input. So we can determin that the time complexity is O(N)


b) In this example we can see that the question only has one for loop and the out put is been effected by. There for the time complexity of this question would be O(N)


c) The time comlexity would be o(N). Recursive function has a liner time complexity and it is safe to assume that it will be ran in n time 


## Exercise II
loop trhough the number n, and each time it get's looped we dived the value of storage by 1/2. we need one correct move to find the value of f. Once we find the value set that as the new f.
